After listening to Jom Rohn I decided to start keeping a journal. I opted for an electronic version. I wanted to keep each month its own file, but also thought it could be useful to be able to concatonate them into one file if I were to use a search function. Thus the concattonator was born. It corrupts .odt (open office files) so I am gonna use .txt instead. I like the simple file format, and its easy to format how I want in a text editor. 

Its pretty simple but taught me the basics of file manipulation with Ruby.
